## What is Adjusteer

Adjusteer is a simple arduino movement motivator.
Attached to a standing desk will it beep afer the configured amount of time of no vertical desk movement.

## Usage

- First, you need to get all components for this project.
    - Arduino (tested with Nano, Uno and Mega, but all major boards should work)
    - HC-SR04 (The distance sensor for arduino)
    - BEEPER (TODO)
- Wire up everything (The sketch tells you what pins to use)
- Upload the sketch (just use arduino ide)
- attach to desk
- attach to power
- done

## Development

Feel free to tiker with the code!
This works ofc with the Arduino IDE, but there is also an upload script for arduino-cli users in the repo.

## Any questiones?

Feel free to open issues / PRs!

## Notes

This is far from done
Be assured that development on this continues, as i use this myself
